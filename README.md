# Elementary School Robotics Club

The goal of an elementary school robotics club is to introduce children to the science and art of programming robots. This 
club will have children program small car style robots that contain a couple wheels and lights. They will learn to move the
bots in different directions by writing software to tell the robot what to do.

This is code to run robots for elementary school kids. While there are many robotics kits available, most
kits are very expensive. These kits are extremely cheap ~$20 each and every part is replaceable.
